### Hi there 👋 

I'm Nathan and I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [Dott](http://ridedott.com), where
we're working on a number of fascinating mathematical modelling and
optimisation tasks.

Previously I've been:
 - A consulting Data Scientist at [CTS](https://cts.co/en-gb/),  
   where I learned a great deal about doing science in the cloud
   (specifically on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)).
 - A Theoretical Physics Postdoc at [Oxford](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/rudolf-peierls-centre-for-theoretical-physics) and [NIKHEF](https://www.nikhef.nl/),  
   where I worked on various aspects of [QCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) phenomenology (mainly with the LHC in mind).
 - A student at [Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and
   [Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/),  
   where I cut my teeth as a Physicist.

I'm interested in mathematics, (Bayesian) statistics and machine learning.
(Pseudo)-randomness has plaid a large part in my career (hello MCMC), and
probably as a consequence of that I like to think about procedural generation in
[art and games](https://github.com/nhartland/forma).

I quite like to build tools, both for my [hobbies](https://github.com/nhartland/love-build) and [professional life](https://github.com/nhartland/dashengine).  While I
mostly work in Python these days, I wrote a lot of [HPC
applications](https://github.com/nhartland/apfelgrid) in C++ in
the past, and will always have a soft spot for Lua.
